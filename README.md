Spree Home Page Features
========================

This adds a section to your spree home page where you can include 'features', which are basically news items. 


Installation
============

First add the reference to your gem file...

    # Gemfile
    gem 'spree_home_page_features', '~> 1.3.0'


Then from your console bundle it & install the migration...

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake spree_home_page_features:install:migrations
    bundle exec rake db:migrate


What can I add to a new feature?
======
+ Title
+ Description
+ Image
+ Related product
+ Related taxon
+ Select if publish or not

Styles
======

When you create a feature in the backend, you have the option of setting a style. This will add the style as class to the feature div. I intended this to be used to allow the site administrator select a backdrop for the article they are writing. To set the available styles in the dropdown, simply add the list of styles you would like available to a decorator in your models directory...

    # app/models/spree/home_page_feature_decorator.rb
    Spree::HomePageFeature.styles = ["style1", "style2", "etc"]

You can then define a css file in your assets folder which define the styles...

    # app/assets/stylesheets/store/home_page_feature_styles.css
    li.feature.style1 { background-color: blue }
    li.feature.style2 { background-color: green }
    li.feature.etc    { background-color: orange }
